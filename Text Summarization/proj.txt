if we have data source it can be interm of structure or unstrurcture form we will reding this data 
& then we will summrerise the the entire information that present inside it 

when we talk wrt summrerise : their are the three way inside the langchain 

    A) Stuff 
    B) Map-reduce 
    C) Refine 

# this is with limited no of text but when you huge text , PDF , then we have to use Diff -Diff types Summerization tech  are 

    # A) Stuff Document chain summerization 
    
    # B) Map-reduce summerization teche (this is very important for larger fiile / data sorces) 
    # here we have 2 imp type 
        # - 1) single prompt 
        # - 2) multiple prompt template 
        
    # C) Refine chain summerization 





A) Stuff :
Stuff Document chain summerization  this is most basic type of summerization that 

ex : if we haev pdf -> if we pdf 10 diff Document inside sdc -> this doc are all get combine and then it is send to particaular prompt template  

challenges :  if the doc is large size(10 k doc) so ,
when it become very big it will not possible to send it directly to LLM  model becz it haev limitation with context size


so , to overcome this problem we use -->  Map-reduce  


B) Map-reduce : inside it if i have a documnets insted of  combine all and giveing  it to prompt template 
first of all we will divide it to the smaller chunk 

along with smaller chunk we pass it to a prompt template and we pass to LLM model then we get summery for each doc 
after this at end we combine all summaries and fillanly we combie it and get our final summery  


Document -> smaller chunk -> prompt -> LLm -> summary --------> final summary (entire doc summeries) &
 " finally whatever summery we get we combine it with another prompt template and get the Final summary "





C) Refine :

It is a just slight modification when compair to map reduce 

we do the below processe for every document : 
documnets-> spitted_doc(chunk) -> prompt -> LLM -> summerization  -----(for 1st doc) 

for 2nd doc :
inside the refine what happend , so before sending the 2nd doc to prompt && LLM  "we are going to take the refrance of 1st doc summerization " 
-conclusion :

(summerization of 1st doc)--> documnets-> spitted_doc(chunk) -> prompt -> LLM -> summerization  

same for 3,4 ,5.... nth documetn this proceess continue  

finnally after covering all the documents we get final summary
